ASP.NET Core Request Bounded Model Validation

Defence is a library that helps you to validate your request bounded model by fluent implementations.

_**Pros :**_
- The main difference between Defence and other libraries is that with Defence you can freely
use _**Dependency Injection (DI)**_ in your validator class, so you can easily do whatever you want for
validating your models before calling Actions. Actually it happens exactly when model bounded by MVC.
For example you can inject your database repository and check some ids.
- It is based on the MVC FilterActions so it can be use in WebApi,Razor Page,etc.
- on Net 6.
- **- New features are coming...**
